# PaylinkWeb

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## PHP Example

As I didn't have time to complete the PHP version of Fizzbuzz and Fibonacci I have included an example below of a PHP / Laravel app I built as an other technical challenge.

## Typescript / Node.js  Express Example

Also I have completed a challenge which makes use of Typescript / Node.js and Express. This is more technical and displays a better representation of my coding standards and abilities.
